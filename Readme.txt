I used http://cssminifier.com/ to minify the print.css and style.css files.

Used http://jpeg-optimizer.com/ to reduce the compression of profilepic.jpg from the img folder and pizzaria.jpg from the Views folder.

Took the pizzeria.jpg image from the images folder and made a resized and compressed copy to use on index.html, reducing the need to scale the large image in HTML and CSS. Photoshop was used for both.
