Index.html Optimization Steps

The major issue in the CRP for this document was the images. CSS was used to resize them, and they weren't compressed. To fix these issues, I used Photoshop to reduce the compression of profilepic.jpg from the img folder and pizzaria.jpg from the Views folder. Photoshop was also used to resize a version of pizzaria.jpg for use on index.html. This file was placed in the img folder and reduced the need to scale the large image in HTML and CSS. The page score was significantly increased with these changes. Finally, I used the tool on http://cssminifier.com/ to minify the print.css and style.css files for index.html, and I removed the link to the external font download from Google.
